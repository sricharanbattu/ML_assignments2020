1. Which language is the code written in?
	The code is written in python 3.7 in spyder editor

2. How to run the code?
	The code is run and tested in spyder editor and anaconda powershell.The latest version of the python(atleast 3.7) should
 	be installed for proper running of the code.
	For part1 of the assignment,part1.py should be run.For part2 of the assignment part2.py should be run. 
	Please refer to question no 5 in this readme file.

3. what are the standard libraries used?
	The standard libraries used are numpy,pandas,matplotlib and sklearn(for part2)

4. What are the files and folders present for this assignment?
	All the data files are present in the 'data' folder. The executable files include:

	1. crudefileprocess.py : The raw file present in the assignment page is extracted as dataset_raw.txt to data folder.
	This file should be cleaned for the further tasks of the assignment. This crude file is cleaned and stored as 
	datasetnew.txt in 'data' folder.

	2. part1.py : All the implementations asked in part1 are performed in part1.py. This file should be run to see
	the results asked in part1 of the assignment

	3. part2.py : All the implementations asked in part2 are performed in part2.py. This file should be run to see
	the results asked in part2 of the assignment

5. Any issues observed while running?
	1.It is observed that in some terminals,part2 is not executed because 'sklearn has no attribure neural_network'.Please
	execute the files in another terminal or install the latest python version if such an error is found

	2. It is observed for some random weight initialisations in part1B, the accuracy is too low as nan values arised.In
	this case please rerun part1.py to observe meaningful accuracy.

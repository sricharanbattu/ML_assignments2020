RESULTS:
At the time of testing in my platform,the results obtained are as follows:It is to be noted that the KMeans scores could vary
because of randomness involved in initialisation of the centroids.Also it is to be noted Agglomeration is forming singleton clusters here.

In the agglomerative txt file in clusters folder,the first cluster is printed in 3 lines instead of 1.

1.Which language is used to write the code?
Python 3.7 is used to write the code. Spyder editor is used to write the code



2. Where should we run the programs?
The programs are tested on spyder editor and Anaconda powershell. Typically, any powershell can be used with python 3.7 installed.
It is enough to run 'main.py' for observing the results.


3.What extra libraries are required for running the files?
Numpy,pandas,scikit-learn


4. What are the files present for the evaluation of the assignment?
There are python scripts and modules present in src folder,the required txt files present in clusters folder and updated csv files in data folder.
	a)src folder:
	i.partA.py: script file for partA of the assignment
	ii.partB.py: module file consisiting of required function definitions for partB
	iii.partC.py: module file consisting of required function definitions for partC
	iv. partD.py: script file for partD
	v. partE.py: module file containing necessary function definitions for partE
	vi. main.py: the results are printed and the cluster texts are formed in this script file.
	It's enough to run only main.py for testing the program
	
	b)data folder:
	i.labelled.csv : given csv file for the assignment
	ii.labelled_m.csv :  the csv file after changing the text name. m stands for modified
	iii. unlabelled_m.csv : tfidf matrix is stored in this csv file.
	iv. unlabelled_m_reduced.csv : after appling PCA, the resultant principle components are stored in this csv file.

	c)clusters folder:
	The text files are as asked in the assignment
